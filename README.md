# TactileSmartboard
The project was the culmination of multiple planning meetings where we discussed the problems existent in our current day. With the recent rise in virtual instruction, we noticed that many professors were resorting to using consumer tablets to provide instruction to their students. While this is a suitable replacement for the classic methods of visually representing the lessons they wish to teach, it has many drawbacks that students, including us, have noticed that these lessons are harder to follow due to the smaller real estate these displays provide. We determined that our solution would work best for professors who wished to provide remote/distanced instruction while having the area to visually represent their lessons on a traditional whiteboard. Utilizing a small assembly of a few parts, we were able to bring the idea of a large-scale pen plotter to fruition through a smaller-scale demonstration. Our bot would operate on an 8.5x11 paper but could be scaled up as necessary. The goals of this project were to create working parts for each division of functionality: hardware, electronics, and software. Our project was unique in its scalability and accuracy of output.
